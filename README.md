# MonstAR
MonstAR is the combination of Monsters and Augmented Reality. It augments the physical experience of playing card games like Pokemon or YuGiOh. 
It´s a project which will be developed by Andreas Riedel, Michael Kronester and Daniel Peters in frame of the AR VR course in UXDM WS21.
## Idea
The goal of the App is to have fun gaming and training the monster and collecting them.
Monsters do have a unique card which can be tracked by image recognition.
There are different variations and every monster belongs to a type.
They also have multiple evolution forms.
They also will have different movesets attacks (about 2 for now).
Optionally they can also be trained/leveled up by connecting to your fitness app (Walking, standing, training)

## Technical 



## Components
Mobile Scene
Image based tracking (on Card but also possible on Smartwatch).
Augmentation of 3D Models of Monsters on the image.
Augmenting Monster Stats around the monster.
Battle Mode between two monsters as soon as two images are recognized and monsters look at each other

Monster Reserve
Walking through a portal into a monster reserve.
seeing all collected monsters in their true size.

## Design Examples
The Design is meant to be abstract and playful. The Habitat will look friendly as it is the natural habitat of your monsters.
