# MonstAR
MonstAR is the combination of Monsters and Augmented Reality. It augments the physical experience of playing card games like Pokemon or YuGiOh. 
ItÂ´s a project which will be developed by Andreas Riedel, Michael Kronester and Daniel Peters in frame of the AR VR course in UXDM WS21.
## Idea

## Technical 

## Components

## Design Examples
The Design is meant to be abstract and playful. The arenas should convey a more tactical and fighting aesthetic. The Zoo will look more friendly as it is the natural habitat of your monsters.
