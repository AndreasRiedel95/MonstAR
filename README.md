# MonstAR
MonstAR is the combination of Monsters and Augmented Reality. It augments the physical experience of playing card games like Pokemon or YuGiOh. 
ItÂ´s a project which will be developed by Andreas Riedel, Michael Kronester and Daniel Peters in frame of the AR VR course in UXDM WS21.

## Design Examples
